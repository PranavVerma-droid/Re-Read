Hey There! ðŸŒ±
Welcome to the School-A-Thon on Sustainability, where Team Re:Read, a squad of passionate minds from Noida, took on the challenge of creating a sustainable future through the power of reading.

### Our Green Mission:
Imagine this: Team Re:Read, a group of enthusiastic designers, came together to build more than just a business model. Our mission was to revolutionize the evergreen activity of reading by recycling and selling second-hand books.

### The Re:Read Revolution:
Into the world of sustainability, we crafted an innovative business model that not only promotes eco-conscious reading but also brings communities together. Re:Read isn't just about selling books; it's about creating a positive change on our planet.

### Challenges in the Eco-Verse:
Our journey wasn't all smooth sailing. Navigating the world of sustainable business models had its twists and turns. From sourcing second-hand books to creating a seamless platform for book lovers, every challenge was a chance to grow. <br>
One notable challenge was balancing the books. We had to ensure our eco-friendly model was financially sustainable while making a real impact on reducing book waste.

### Lessons from the Green Pages:
This wasn't just a competition; it was a journey into sustainability. We learned the power of combining innovation with purpose, turning a simple idea into a force for change.
